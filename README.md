# Express Local Library App

This is an example MVC app that uses Express, Mongoose, and PUG templates (based on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website).

To run the app, check out the repository and create a `.env` file at the project root that looks like this:

```
MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://username:password@server/path?option1=true&option2=true"
```

Then run `npm run start`.
